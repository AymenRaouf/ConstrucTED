28|2|1|Gil Strang's Final 18.06 Linear Algebra Lecture|2023-05-15T16:11:07Z|Speakers:  Gilbert Strang, Alan Edelman, Pavel Grinfeld, Michel Goemans   Revered mathematics professor Gilbert Strang capped a 61-year career as a faculty member at MIT by delivering his final 18.06 Linear Algebra lecture before retiring at the age of 88. In addition to a brief review for the course final exam, the overflowing audience (both in person and on the live YouTube stream) heard recollections, appreciations, and congratulations from Prof. Strang’s colleagues and former students.  A rousing standing ovation concluded this historic event.  This video has been dubbed using an artificial voice via https://aloud.area120.google.com to increase accessibility.

Meyer  This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:  1)Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations. 2)Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting. 3)Discrete probability theory.  On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.

Meyer  This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:  1)Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations. 2)Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting. 3)Discrete probability theory.  On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.
